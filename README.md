# Rust-Practice
### Overview

This repository is dedicated to learning Rust. It contains notes, experiments, and implementations of algorithms that I have created as part of my daily programming practice. The goal of this repository is to track my progress and share my knowledge with others who are also learning Rust.

### Materials Used

- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html)

### Contents

- Notes: Notes on various concepts and topics related to Rust.
- Experiments: Small projects and experiments that I have created to practice and apply what I have learned.
- Algorithms: Implementations of common algorithms in Rust.
- Other: Miscellaneous files related to my learning process.

### Usage
Feel free to use the contents of this repository as a reference or learning resource. Please note that some portions of the code and notes may have been sourced from various blogs, professors, and Stack Overflow, and I cannot claim that all work is entirely my own. 

### About Me
I am a student and I am trying to master these languages on my own. I try to dedicate at least one hour each day to practicing and improvement. I am currently focusing on Swift, Python and Rust as part of my daily programming study plan.
